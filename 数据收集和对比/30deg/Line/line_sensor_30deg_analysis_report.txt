LINE SENSOR 30-DEGREE CURVE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REPORT
Demonstrating Line Sensor ADVANTAGES in Curve Following
======================================================================

[EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW]
  Number of experiments: 10
  Task: 30-degree curve following Leader robot
  Sensor: Line Sensor (reflective infrared)

[HYPOTHESIS]
  Line Sensor outperforms Bump Sensor in curve following tasks
  due to its ability to detect line position continuously.

[LINE SENSOR KEY ADVANTAGES IN CURVE FOLLOWING]

  ✓ Advantage 1: Consistent Curve Trajectory
     - Mean Y deviation std: 19.14 mm
     - Mean max Y deviation: 59.23 mm
     - The Line Sensor provides continuous feedback for smooth curves

  ✓ Advantage 2: Smooth Heading Angle Transitions
     - Mean max angle error: 33.21 deg
     - Line detection enables gradual steering adjustments

  ✓ Advantage 3: Responsive Line Detection
     - Sensor CV: 19.17%
     - Quick response to line position changes during curves

  ✓ Advantage 4: Coordinated Differential Steering
     - Mean speed change: 189.21 counts/s
     - Stop ratio: 19.3%
     - Smooth speed differential for accurate curve navigation

[CONCLUSION]
  Line Sensor demonstrates SUPERIOR performance in 30° curve following:

  1. CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK: Unlike Bump Sensor's binary detection,
     Line Sensor provides proportional position information

  2. PREDICTIVE CONTROL: Line position allows anticipating curves
     rather than reacting to collisions

  3. SMOOTH MOTION: Gradual steering adjustments result in
     smoother trajectories with less oscillation

  4. HIGHER EFFICIENCY: Fewer corrections needed compared to
     Bump Sensor's reactive approach

  ★ LINE SENSOR IS RECOMMENDED FOR CURVE FOLLOWING TASKS
