BUMP SENSOR 30-DEGREE CURVE FOLLOWING PROBLEM REPORT
Demonstrating Bump Sensor DISADVANTAGES in Curve Following
======================================================================

[EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW]
  Number of experiments: 10
  Task: 30-degree curve following Leader robot
  Sensor: Bump Sensor (proximity detection)

[HYPOTHESIS]
  Line Sensor outperforms Bump Sensor in curve following tasks.
  This report demonstrates the limitations of Bump Sensor.

[BUMP SENSOR KEY DISADVANTAGES IN CURVE FOLLOWING]

  ✗ Problem 1: Inconsistent Curve Trajectory
     - Mean Y deviation std: 36.65 mm
     - Mean max Y deviation: 121.32 mm
     - Bump Sensor lacks continuous position feedback

  ✗ Problem 2: Erratic Heading Angle Changes
     - Mean max angle error: 39.75 deg
     - Reactive control causes over-correction

  ✗ Problem 3: Non-Proportional Sensor Response
     - Sensor CV: 72.13%
     - Binary detection unsuitable for gradual curves

  ✗ Problem 4: Jerky Speed Control
     - Mean speed change: 200.07 counts/s
     - Stop ratio: 7.7%
     - Frequent corrections lead to inefficient motion

[WHY BUMP SENSOR FAILS IN CURVE FOLLOWING]

  1. REACTIVE CONTROL: Bump Sensor only detects when too close,
     causing delayed reactions and overshooting during curves

  2. NO POSITION GRADIENT: Unlike Line Sensor, Bump Sensor cannot
     detect how far off-course the robot is, only proximity

  3. OSCILLATION: Constant correction-overcorrection cycle
     leads to zigzag motion instead of smooth curves

  4. SPEED INEFFICIENCY: Frequent stops and accelerations
     waste energy and slow overall progress

[CONCLUSION]
  Bump Sensor demonstrates INFERIOR performance in 30° curve following:

  • Trajectories are inconsistent across experiments
  • Heading angle changes are erratic and unpredictable
  • Sensor provides no proportional feedback for curves
  • Motion is jerky with frequent corrections

  ★ LINE SENSOR IS SUPERIOR FOR CURVE FOLLOWING TASKS
  ★ BUMP SENSOR IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CURVED PATHS
